# Makerere training
Materials for the Starsim training workshops at Makerere School of Public Health, July 2023


## Installation
You can clone, fork, or download this repository to get a local copy of all the scripts.

## Setting up and running
To run these scripts, you will need to have [HPVsim](http://hpvsim.org) and [Covasim](http://covasim.org) installed. Follow the instructions at each of those locations to install them. You may wish to install them within a conda environment, then use that same conda environment when running the scripts.

Once you have installed HPVsim and Covasim, you can run test_install to make sure that everything is working correctly.

## Structure
- the folder `hpvsim_uganda` contains scripts for running HPVsim for Uganda.
- the folder `ltbi` contains scripts for analysing latent TB infection data.
- the folder `covasim` contains scripts for running Covasim.
